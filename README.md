Code for Bias Correction in Medical Image

FCM_Demo.m is the main files for image reading and outputing
fcm_energy.m is designed for energy calculation in the process of optimization
FCM_mul.m for optimization including three parameters: the value of class center C, the probability of every pixel belong to each class u and bias field b.
